PG24 Pedro -> Pipelines Build automation tool

The AutoBuild.cmd creates a new build for an Unreal project and stores it in a 
new folder on the H drive with a time stamp.

It only works for an Unreal project, it pulls from a repo (if there is one in the folder) and drops the build 
In a new directory in the H Drive. 

Using instructions:

Open the AutoBuild.cmd file in your editor of choice.

Substitute the SRC variable to the location of your Unreal project folder and change the PROJECT variable to the name of the Unreal project (please, omit the .uproject extention).
